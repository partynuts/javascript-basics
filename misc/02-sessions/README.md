# Misc 02 | Sessions

## Idea

Session = Connection between consumer and server which is identified by shared (and ideally encrypted) value (aka sessionId)
Establishment:
- Consumer provides credentials
- Server verifies it
- Stores state on server side
- Sends (encrypted) sessionId back as cookie
- Every future request between consumer and server forwards cookie and respectively authenticates the user
- Session expires when cookie expires (or when logout is triggered)

## Steps

1. Run app
2. Login and verify the cookies, the logs, the database
3. Logout and check again
4. Implement user registration (You may ignore password hashing for nowâ€¦)
5. Verify on login if user credentials are correct
6. Optional: Encrypt the user's password.
